# CheckersMiniMaxAlg
Created a Checkers game in java implementing minimax algorithm that always ties or wins when played against a user.

Language used – java
Goals of the project:
-learn about minimax algorithm implementation 
-learn about designing a game model
-implement the minimax algorithm to create a game of checkers where the program always either wins or ties when played against a user

The program consists of four files:
  •	Algorithm – implementation of minimax algorithm and its versions
  •	State – Game model implementation (moves allowed, initial set up of the board, applicable actions, …)
  •	Runner – in charge of dynamic part of the game (runs the game and determines what happens after each move)
  •	Main – prompts used for the input and runs the program
